# This project structure uses atomic design. Therefore, there are several key directories:

-   atoms: The smallest functional piece, such as a textfield or image wrapper
-   molecules: combinations of atoms, something like a selection menu
-   organisms: combinations of molecules, something such as a navigation bar
-   templates: layouts of pages which organisms can slot into
-   pages: specific instances of templates that have organisms slotted in
